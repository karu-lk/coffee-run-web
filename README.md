# COFFEE RUN WEB APP
## Coffee Run web application using React

## Summary
It is not complete if the right user experience is not provided. At least, you should build a 'minimum featured' user interface to interact with technical jargon.

That's the primary purpose of building this app. It consumes data from a RESTful API hosted on AWS App Runner and displays it on the home page. I can introduce a lot of cool ideas to this web app, but should I?
